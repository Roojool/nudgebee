// around the seed, not only what started before it. Deciding per row, looking
// strictly backwards, made the answer depend on arrival order: three alerts
// starting in the same second never saw each other, a cause arriving after its
// symptoms was filed under one of them, and a second copy of an alert from
// another ingest path could be picked in place of the copy that carried the link.

//     alert heads the group — this firing, or an earlier one heading a group a
//     related alert is in — the seed is one more row of the head. This is also
//     what stops the lead passing back and forth: each seed ranks with its own
//     stored service map, two maps can disagree, and only an alert new to a
//     group may change who heads it.
//
//     An EARLIER firing of the seed's alert places it only while another
//     alert in that group has fired inside the window. A group stays open while
//     different alerts keep firing beside each other; one alert's own repeats do
//     not hold it open, or a flapper would keep an incident alive for days under
//     a headline long out of view.
//
//  2. If related alerts are already in groups, the seed joins the group whose
//     head ranks best. It replaces that head only when it outranks it. Groups are
//     never merged.
//
//  3. With no group yet, the head is the best-ranked of the seed and its related
//     alerts. Every alert triaged from the same set reaches the same answer.
//
