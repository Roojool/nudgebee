// predicate failure is usually transient (the llm_judge model call).

// Prime runs one observation + predicate evaluation synchronously, before a
// watch row exists.
//
// Why this exists: without it the first poll lands a full poll_interval after
// registration, and the agent's turn is long over by the time anything is
// known. Every FAILED watch in the dev metastore is an "observe failed: ..."
// — a missing tool config, an expired GitHub App token, a command that cannot
// run — which is exactly the class the agent could have corrected in the same
// turn if it had been told. It also short-circuits the "already done" case:
// registering a background job for something that has already finished costs
// the user a poll interval of waiting for an answer the agent could give now.
//
// Priming deliberately runs under the CALLER's security context, not the
// static admin context a dispatcher poll uses (buildWatchSecurityContext),
// so the check reflects what the requesting user may actually do rather than
// what an admin could.
//
// Known asymmetry, accepted: a caller whose own session is narrower than that
// admin context could fail the probe on a source whose real polls would have
// succeeded, costing a registration. The reverse — priming under admin — would
// let registration validate a command the requesting user cannot run, and the
// watch then drives that command unattended for up to WatchMaxDurationSec.
// Rejecting too much is the safer direction, so it stays.
//
// The observation is thrown away on success: Prime never writes, and a watch
// row is still created by the caller in the normal not-yet-met case.
