"""Assemble the documents a PDF is indexed as: one per page of text, one per figure.

Ported from llm-server's ``tools/core/knowledgebase_pdf.go``
(``buildKBPDFChunkTexts``) as part of moving ingestion into this service, and
kept behaviourally identical to it — the Go tests in
``knowledgebase_pdf_test.go`` have counterparts in ``tests/test_pdf_chunks.py``.

A figure gets its own chunk rather than being appended to its page so that a
question answered by the diagram retrieves the diagram, not the page of prose
that happens to surround it. Each chunk carries its own header, because a chunk
is read on its own once retrieval has picked it.

One deliberate difference from the Go: budgets here are counted in characters
rather than bytes. Go's ``len`` is bytes, which would chunk a Japanese or
Cyrillic page at roughly a third of the intended length.
