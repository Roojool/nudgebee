// Nubi > b-Cortex > Memory > Collective (app/src/ee/components/memory2/CollectiveTab.jsx).
// The tab browses the tenant's shared agent memory, grouped by module, with a debounced
// full-text search over it. Its one mutating control is a per-row Delete, and Collective
// rows are tenant-wide memory the agents wrote from real conversations — injected into
// everyone's future prompts, with no create path on this tab to put one back — so nothing
// here confirms a delete. The two delete cases open the confirmation, assert what it says,
// and Cancel.
//
// That leaves the suite with no fixtures to create and nothing to clean up, so every case
// is order-free and safe to run twice, which matters because CI sets retries: 1. The search
// cases type into the box and every case opens the tab fresh, so no case inherits a filter
// from the one before it.
