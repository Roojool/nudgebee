// Nubi > global chat — the floating launcher and the docked panel _app.tsx mounts on every
// page (app/src/components/llm/NubiGlobalChat.tsx, app/src/context/NubiGlobalChatContext.tsx).
//
// Nothing here asks Nubi a question. The panel embeds the same generator the full /ask-nudgebee
// page does, and that conversation surface is already covered by tests/nubi/chat-history and
// tests/nubi/askNudgebee.spec.ts — so these cases stay on what only the panel has: the
// launcher, the header controls, the chat-local account chip, the drawer's width, and the two
// routes the launcher deliberately withdraws from. That leaves no conversation, no account
// setting and no server record created, so every case is order-free and safe to run twice.
//
// The one exception is the resize case, which commits a width to localStorage. It clears that
// key before it starts and again in a finally, so a run that dies mid-drag cannot hand the next
// run a pre-widened panel.
